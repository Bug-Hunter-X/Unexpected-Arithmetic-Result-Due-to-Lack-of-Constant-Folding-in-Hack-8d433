This issue is not easily solved without modifying the Hack compiler to perform constant folding.  The solution lies in refactoring the code to avoid the reliance on implicit constant folding.  While a direct solution within the code itself is not possible, a workaround is to pre-compute the values if the inputs are known at compile time.  This makes the code less elegant but ensures correct results:

```hack
<?hh
function foo(x: int): int {  return x + 1; }
function bar(x: int): int {  return foo(x) * 2; }
function baz(x: int): int {
  $intermediate = foo(x);
  $intermediate2 = $intermediate * 2;
  return $intermediate2 -1; 
}
echo baz(5); // outputs 10
?>
```
Alternatively, if possible, rewrite the functions to perform the calculation directly instead of relying on multiple function calls. This approach can also help to improve the readability and efficiency of the code.
